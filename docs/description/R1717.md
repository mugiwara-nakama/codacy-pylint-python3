# consider-using-dict-comprehension (R1717)
*Consider using a dictionary comprehension* Emitted when we detect the
creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable and a transient list.
Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard
to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension.Also it is faster
since you don\'t need to create another transient list
